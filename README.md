# VagrantiSH

Basic installation scripts for post installation of Vagrant boxes.

I personally use this scripts to setup vagrant boxes after they are installed.
The current scripts are made for Ubuntu Xenial64.
The virtual box image url is https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64.

Feel free to use them, copy them, or whatever, at your own risk.
If you want to point out how much I still have to learn about bash,
comments and/or commits are more than welcome!.
